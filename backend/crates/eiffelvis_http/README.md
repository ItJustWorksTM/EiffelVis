# Eiffelvis Http
The http library consumes a graph and exposes querying functionality over the internet, most importantly, it adds real time support for querying and receiving eiffel events as they come in.

This library is intentionally small and only does the bare minimum amount of work to function, it should be seen as a thin wrapper around the core library.

See our [first class frontend](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/EiffelVis/blob/master/frontend/src/eiffelvis.ts) as an example on how to effectively use this interface.
