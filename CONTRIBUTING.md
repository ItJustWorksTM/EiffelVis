## Contributing
Contributing to the project will most likely be in the form of a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
So when you want to submit a bug fix or a documentation improvement, fork the repo, apply your changes and create a pull request. A maintainer of the project will look over the pull request and give feedback on how to it might be improved. When all feedback is resolved the PR will be accepted into the repository 

In case you want to contribute larger amounts of work be sure to contact the project maintainers before hand to discuss your plans and see if it aligns with the project vision.
